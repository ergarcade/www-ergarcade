            <p class="centre">
            There is no standard between ergometer manufacturers for how they
            build their machines, nor how they calculate the metrics that appear
            on their monitors. In this article we provide charts of the
            relationship between RPM, speed and power for the Concept2 BikeErg,
            Schwinn AirDyne6, Assault bike and Rogue Echo bike.

        Below is a description of how the data for these charts was assembled.
        Reading this is not necessary.

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>
        Data for the Concept2 BikeErg was collected in the same manner as
        <a href="/articles/bikeerg-damper-pace-derivatives.html">described in
            this article</a>. The Schwinn AirDyne6, Assault bike and Rogue Echo
        data were collected by video recording the respective manufacturers'
        monitors at increasing RPM.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The BikeErg used in testing was brand new.</li>
            <li>The Schwinn AirDyne6 was quite a few years old. However,
                it has had regular maintenance, including belts being
                replaced prior to testing.</li>
            <li>The Assault bike was less than 6 months old.</li>
            <li>The Rogue Echo was a couple of years old.</li>
            <li>Flywheel cages had dust and debris brushed out.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />
        <h2>Collation</h2>
        <p>
        Data was collated in the same manner as <a
            href="/articles/bikeerg-damper-pace-derivatives.html">described
            previously</a>.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <h2>Caveats</h2>
        <p>
        The graphs presented above are based on results recorded on a single
        machine. Your may see different results on your own devices due to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Different amount of flywheel dust or debris which alters drag
                factor;</li>
            <li>Air pressure differences, notably from differing altitudes,
                again impacting drag factor;</li>
            <li>Differing amounts of wear on machines.</li>
        </ul>
